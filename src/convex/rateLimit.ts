/**
 * Fixed-window rate limiting for the operations that cost money or send
 * messages.
 *
 * Convex has no built-in per-caller throttle, and several endpoints here are
 * abusable: booking creation writes a row and broadcasts onto the job radar,
 * chat inserts are unbounded, and every sign-in attempt triggers an outbound
 * email through a paid provider. Without a limit, one script can flood the
 * radar, the inbox of an arbitrary third party, or the cooperative's data.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - State is per (scope, subject), never global. A single shared counter would
 *    let anyone exhaust the budget and lock out every real user at once.
 *  - The window is fixed rather than sliding so one row per key is enough and
 *    the table stays small.
 *  - Callers that legitimately retry (a member re-sending a code after a typo)
 *    stay well under the limits below.
