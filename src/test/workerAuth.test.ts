/**
 * Worker sign-in: phone number handling, the SMS throttle, and portal routing.

 * the wrong thing: a number that normalises differently between the send and
 * the verify step locks a worker out of their own account, an unthrottled SMS
 * endpoint bills the cooperative, and a mis-routed redirect drops a worker into
 * the customer portal.
